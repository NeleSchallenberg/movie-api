# Movie API
This project is the server-side component of the Female Filmmakers web application.
It was built built as a task for Achievement 2 in Career Foundry's Full-Stack Web Development Program.

The web application will provide users with access to information about different female filmmakers and their work.
For now, the database consists of several female directors and their feature-length films (with a minimum of 80 minutes as defined by the Screen Actors Guild).
Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

The next step is to create the client-side part of the application.

In the future, I want to update the database with women in other off-screen professions such as writers, cinematographers and production designers and include a function to find a specific person by name and receive general information about them, as well as a list of their work.
