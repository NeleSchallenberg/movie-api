        <h1>Achievement 2 Project</h1>
        <h2>Female Filmmakers API</h2>
        <p>
            This project is the server-side component of a “female filmmakers” web application.
            The web application will provide users with access to information about different female filmmakers and their work.<br>
            For now, the database consists of several female directors and their feature-length films (with a minimum of 80 minutes as defined by the Screen Actors Guild).<br>
            Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.<br>
            In the future, I want to update the database with women in other off-screen professions such as writers, cinematographers and production designers and include 
            a function to find a specific person by name and receive general information about them, as well as a list of their work.
        </p>
